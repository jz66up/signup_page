Here is the live weblink for my Asgardian Amry Sign-up page: [sign-up page](https://jz66up.github.io/signup_page/). This website does exactly what the name suggests it does. 

## What I learnt throughout said project

1. I learnt how to make a basic form. From Passwords to phone numbers, I learnt how to code the different inputs and sytle them.
2. `a` tag defines a hyperlink which when pressed can link you to another website
3. `position` which allows a `div` to be position in different ways. 
   They include: `position: static`, `position: relative`, `position: sticky`, `position: absoulte`, and `position: fixed`
4. `min` and `max` has two parameters, for example `max(450px, 35%)`, from which `max` will choose the bigger of the two values and use it, and `min` will choose the smaller of the two
5. `input:valid` can be used to style the input when it is `valid`
